# Hello, world!

My name is Jackson, but you can call me vesche. Welcome to my cozy internet home, glad you're here. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Swimlane](https://swimlane.com/). I spend most of my time hacking on *nix systems because it's what I'm most passionate about.

My interests are in:
* Computer security
* Programming in Python & C
* Linux
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploit & tool development
* Malware & RE
* Network security monitoring
