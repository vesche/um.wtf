# Hello, world!

Welcome to my cozy internet home. My name is Austin & my handle is vesche. I'm currently working at [CLEAR](https://www.clearme.com/) where I hack things so other people can't hack things. I spend most of my time building and breaking things on a \*nix system because that's what I'm most passionate about.

My interests are primarily in:
* Computer security
* Programming Python, C, and Go
* Linux
* Reverse engineering
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploit & tool development
* Malware analysis
* Network security monitoring

You can find me on:
