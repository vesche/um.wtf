# Hello, world!

My name is Austin Jackson, but you can call me vesche. This is my cozy internet home, glad you're here. I am currently working as a Security Analyst on an incident response team in Maryland. Primarily, I'm a Python developer and Linux enthusiast. However, I'm also interested in malware, reverse engineering, penetration testing, network security monitoring, exploit development, vulnerability analysis, and forensics. I spend pretty much all of my time fiddling around with computers because it's what I'm most passionate about.
