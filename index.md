Welcome to my cozy internet home. My name is Austin and my handle is vesche. I spend most of my time building and breaking things on a \*nix system because that's what I'm most passionate about. My interests are primarily in computer security, programming, threat hunting, Linux, exploits, malware, and reverse engineering. I'm not currently looking for work, but you can get in contact with me below if you'd like to say hi.

You can find me on:

* [Email](vesche@protonmail.com)
