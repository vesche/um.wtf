Welcome to my cozy internet home. My name is Austin (aka vesche). I spend most of my time building and breaking things on Linux systems because that's what I'm most passionate about. My interests are primarily in computer security, programming, threat hunting, exploits, malware, and reverse engineering. I'm currently working as a software engineer & security researcher at [Cyborg Security](https://cyborgsecurity.com). I'm also the co-founder of [Cyvoyance](https://cyvoyance.com), a cyber security consulting firm that specializes in tailored services. Thanks for stopping by!
