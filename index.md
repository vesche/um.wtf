# Hello, world!

![me](me.jpg)

My name is Austin Jackson, but you can call me vesche. This is my cozy internet home, glad you're here. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at [Swimlane](https://swimlane.com/). I spend a lot of my time fiddling around with computers because it's what I'm most passionate about.

Primarily, I'm interested in:
* Computer security
* Python
* Linux
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploit & tool development
* Network security monitoring
* Malware

However, I'm a total geek and many other hobbies vie for my attention:
* Hobby programming
* Film
* Hard sci-fi
* Gamedev
* Embedded device hacking
* Deep learning
* Aquaponics
