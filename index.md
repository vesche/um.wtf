# Hello, world!

Welcome to my cozy internet home. My name is Jackson & my handle is vesche. I spend most of my time hacking something on a \*nix system because that's what I'm most passionate about.

My interests are primarily in:
* Computer security
* Programming Python, C, and Go
* Linux
* Reverse engineering
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploit & tool development

You can contact me at vesche@protonmail.com
