Welcome to my cozy internet home. My name is Austin and my handle is vesche. I spend most of my time building and breaking things on a \*nix system because that's what I'm most passionate about. My interests are primarily in computer security, programming, threat hunting, Linux, exploits, malware, and reverse engineering. I'm currently working as a software engineer & security researcher at [Cyborg Security](https://cyborgsecurity.com). I'm the co-founder of [Cyvoyance](https://cyvoyance.com), a cyber security consulting firm that specializes in tailored services.
