# Hello, world!

![me](img/me.jpg)

My name is Austin Jackson, but you can call me vesche. This is my cozy internet home, glad you're here. I am currently working as a security analyst & software developer on an incident response team in Maryland. I spend pretty much all of my time fiddling around with computers because it's what I'm most passionate about.

Primarily, I'm interested in:
* Computer security
* Python
* Linux
* Vulnerability analysis
* Exploit / tool development
* Penetration testing
* Network security monitoring
* Malware analysis

However, I'm a total geek and many other hobbies vie for my attention:
* Skiing
* Hobby programming
* Movies
* Hard sci-fi
* Gamedev
* Hardware hacking
* Artificial intellegence
* Deep learning
* Robotics
* Physical cosmology
* Quantum mechanics
* Aquaponics
* Mycology
* Absurdism
* Tattoos
* Co-op video games
