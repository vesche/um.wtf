        <p><br>Hello, world! My name is Austin Jackson, but you can call me vesche. This is my cozy internet home, glad you're here. I am currently a Network Security Analyst in the military working for an incident response team. I get to do a lot of cool things in my day job depending on what's going on including network traffic analysis, writing Python tools, configuring Linux systems, working on various network devices, host based analysis, pen testing, forensics, malware analysis, etc. I fiddle around with computers just as much outside of work as I do at work. I really enjoy programming, I mostly write Python, Golang, and C. Check out my <a href='https://github.com/vesche'>Github</a> if you'd like to see what I'm working on, I dump a lot of my code into my <a href='https://github.com/vesche/snippets'>snippets</a> repository. I'm also a huge Linux enthusiast, my primary development machine is an Acer C720 that runs Arch Linux. I endlessly mess around with my <a href='https://github.com/vesche/dotfiles'>dotfiles</a>, because I love customizing my operating system. I hope to write about a lot of different subject matters on this blog, because I have a very wide range of interests. Anything from hobby programming and Linux ricing to neural networks and computer security. Maybe I'll write something that interests you.<br><br>You can also find me on <a href='https://github.com/vesche'>Github</a>, <a href='https://reddit.com/u/vesche'>Reddit</a>, and <a href='http://stackoverflow.com/users/4396927/vesche?tab=profile'>Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
