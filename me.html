Hello, world! My name is Austin Jackson, but you can call me vesche. This is my
cozy internet home, glad you're here. I'm currently working as a Network
Security Analyst on an incident response team. I live in Maryland with my wife
and my cat. I spend pretty much all my time fiddling around with computers,
because it's what I'm most passionate about. I really enjoy programming, I
mostly write Python, Golang, and C. I'm also a Linux enthusiast, my primary
development machine is an Acer C720 that runs Arch Linux. I endlessly mess
around with my <a href='https://github.com/vesche/dotfiles'>dotfiles</a>,
because I love customizing my workflow. I hope to write about a lot of
different subject matters on this blog, anything from Linux ricing and hobby
programming to neural networks and computer security. Stick around, maybe I'll
write something that interests you.<br><br> You can also find me on
<a href='https://github.com/vesche'>Github</a>,
<a href='https://reddit.com/u/vesche'>Reddit</a>, and
